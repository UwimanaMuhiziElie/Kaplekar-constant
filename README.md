# Kaprekar's Constant 6174
There is a rule in Math that applies to 4 digit numbers. for each 4 digit number that is not made of all repetitive numbers,and not start with zero.if you subtract the ascending order of that number from the descending order of it, it will eventually end up in Kaprekar's Constant which is 6174.

let's take 2718we take the ascending order from the descending one, and repeat the whole process we will get this:

 '8721 - 1278 = 7443',
 '7443 - 3447 = 3996',
 '9963 - 3699 = 6264',
 '6642 - 2466 = 4176',
 '7641 - 1467 = 6174'
 

continues like this until you reach on number 6174 as the final answer. then display the number of iterations it took to reach 6174.
like here it takes 5 iterations to reach to kaplekars's constant

Run
> Enter 4 digits number

output

> it takes n iterations to reach to kaplekar's constant.
